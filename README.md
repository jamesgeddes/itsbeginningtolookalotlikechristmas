itsbeginningtolookalotlikechristmas graphs the onset of Christmas through the popularity of the

classic, "[It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas](https://youtu.be/KmddeUJJEuU)" over time.
Where [IsItChristmas.com](https://isitchristmas.com) gives you a simple yes or no,

### Why?

Computer Scientists like specific definitions of things, as that makes it easier to codify them.
Christmasyness is seemingly a very emotional state that would be almost impossible to design,
but in 1951, Perry Como and The Fontane Sisters with Mitchell Ayres & His Orchestra gave us the
perfect marker. The question, "Is it beginning to look a lot like Christmas?" can therefore be
answered with the specific definition of the popularity of the song "It's Beginning to Look a
Lot Like Christmas".

### How it works

[ItsBeginningToLookALotLike.Christmas](http://ItsBeginningToLookALotLike.Christmas) works by
polling the Spotify API every day to get the popularity of track ID
`2pXpURmn6zC5ZYDMms6fwa`. We then timestamp
this and chuck it at a pretty graph. Grab some Eggnog and watch Christmas cheer gradually spread
throughout the land.

GitHub Actions is used to run the python script that gets the data. GitHub pages then displays the page.
This is not how one would likely want to structure the infrastructure for an enterprise application, but
this works for now.

### Future improvements

These could be added in the future. PRs welcome!

- Local radio<br />
  In the future, other sources will be added to further improve accuracy. Local radio stations
  will be sampled at regular intervals for the
  [fingerprint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_fingerprint)
  of our favourite definition of Christmastime.
- Christmas map<br />
  When we include the location of those stations, we will also be able to _map_ the spread of
  Christmasyness over time. This will also allow us to produce a Christmas heatmap of the most
  Christmasy locales.

### Motivation

The motivation for this project is that it is,

- [rather silly](https://youtu.be/3ANufwUPFm8).
- able to show that the data driven mindset can be applied to all areas if you can just find the
  right metrics.
- a great demonstration of the principles of
    - DevOps
    - Continuous Integration
    - Continuous Delivery - [read the CD Bible now](https://amzn.to/3Wxh2GE)
    - progress is better than perfection
